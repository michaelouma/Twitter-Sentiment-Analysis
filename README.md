# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
## Natural Language Processing(NLP) Analysis
NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important. Also NLP make it easy by classifying a speech or text as either positive, negative or neautral.


## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiment from Twitter data. It utilizes machine learning techniques to classify tweets into different sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). The goal is to understand public sentiment about various topics, events, or products.

## Features
 **Data colection**:   Data used for this analysis was obtained from kaggle.com.<br>
 **Preprocessing**:   Data cleaning and preprocessing of tweet texts.<br>
 ### Word Cloud Analysis
 A word cloud (or tag cloud) is a visual representation of text data, typically used to depict keyword metadata (tags) on websites or to visualize free-form text. In a word cloud, the importance or frequency of each word is shown with font size or color. Words that appear more frequently in the source text are displayed in larger, bolder fonts, making them stand out.
 **Model training**:   Trains machine learning models to classify tweet sentiment.<br>
 **Evaluation**:   Evaluates model performance using various metrics.
